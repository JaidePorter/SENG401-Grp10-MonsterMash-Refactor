Applications in the System

There are two distinct applications - the client program, which runs in a web browser on the player's computer, and the server program, which will run on a server in the University.

Our client program will be what the player will see in the web browser. With this application, the player will be able to send friend requests, fight requests and other actions to the server to be passed along to another player or other places, depending on the action. They can sell their monsters, breed their monsters with other players, and have their monsters fight with other players' monsters.

The server will generate the pages that are handed to the client program (the web browser). It will also pass data from the database to the users when required - such as the data from the marketplace, the leader board and the breeding market. Actions in the client program, such as selling a monster, will be passed back to the database on the server via the PersistenceManager.

Servers will also interact with each other, by hosting cross-server fights between players, trades and friend requests.
